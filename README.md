## Simple DB example with IIS Application


</div>

### Description

This is a VERY SIMPLE IIS application which main purpose is to display that how to use web items, HTML template and database. If you people think that you need to know more about this fantastic but less talked feature of VB then please RATE THIS CODE and give me reviews.

These applications are basicly designed to run on windows NT IIS(Internet Information Server) 3.0 or later. But if you want to run them on windows 98 then browse your windows CD for the PWS(Personal Web Server) and install it.

Remember don't expect PROFFESIONALITY in this project, although can be achieved easily
